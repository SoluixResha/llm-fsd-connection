## Environment Variables (Future Use)

When integrating with Supabase or AI services, add these in Netlify Dashboard:

```
VITE_SUPABASE_URL=your_supabase_project_url
VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_supabase_anon_key
VITE_AI_API_URL=your_ai_service_url
VITE_AI_API_KEY=your_ai_api_key
```

## Post-Deployment Steps

### 1. Verify Deployment
- [ ] Site loads correctly
- [ ] All tabs work (Chat, Documents, File Connections)

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

### Build Fails
- Check Node.js version (should be 18+)
- Verify all dependencies are installed
- Check for TypeScript errors

### 404 Errors on Refresh
- Ensure `_redirects` file is in place
- Check `netlify.toml` redirect rules

### Assets Not Loading
- Verify `dist` folder is being published
- Check asset paths in build output

### Environment Variables Not Working
- Ensure variables start with `VITE_`
- Check Netlify environment variable settings
- Rebuild and redeploy after adding variables

## Production Optimizations

### Already Configured
- âœ… Chunk splitting for better caching
- âœ… Vendor chunks separated
- âœ… Asset compression
- âœ… Security headers
- âœ… SPA routing

### Future Enhancements
- [ ] Service Worker for offline support
- [ ] Progressive Web App (PWA) features
- [ ] Advanced analytics integration
- [ ] Error tracking (Sentry, etc.)
- [ ] Performance monitoring

## Support

If you encounter issues:
1. Check the Netlify deploy logs
2. Review the browser console for errors
3. Verify all configuration files are in place
4. Test locally with `npm run preview`
